I realized something the other day. I never get bored anymore. On my phone I have Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Kindle, Reddit, ProductHunt, and more. I'm also receiving messages, emails, and Snapchats simultaneously. I'm never really bored anymore, my mind has an infinite amount of information to wade through.

Wandering around useless information is a habit I'm trying to break. It's hard. The human brain loves having effortless access to information and entertainment. It's easy to get lost in post after post on Reddit or Facebook. I don't particularly enjoy browsing any of those apps either, so why do I keep opening them?

Having users who keep returning is the way most internet companies make money, so that's what they optimize for. Facebook doesn't care if you're having fun, they want you to keep coming back to look at ads. Zuck figured out that fun and boredom are actually not opposites. Boredom and not-boredom are.

What is "not-boredom"? It's that feeling you get when you're mindless browsing. Scrolling a newsfeed of pictures you don't really care about. Sorting through status updates that don't really affect you at all. You're not enjoying life and you're not learning. You're barely even paying attention. You're not having fun, you're just not-bored. In other words, you're mindlessly wasting your time.

I keep meeting aspiring entrepreneurs who have come up with some crazy new idea for a social app. Social apps can be a powerful tool[^arabspring], but we're oversaturated. Just count how many different apps you have that all have a separate timeline, inbox, notification feed, and friend tab. How many timelines do you scroll in a day? How many do you really care about?

Let's build something better than a new social app. The next game changing company probably isn't going to be a social media product. Even if you do get lucky and build the next Snapchat, is that really going to leave a dent in the universe?

Next time you're in public look at how people use their smartphone. The vast majority of people are using the pinnacle of modern engineering to turn their brain off while scrolling some feed in some app. We can do better.
