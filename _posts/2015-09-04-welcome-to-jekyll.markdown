I rebuilt my personal website in May after a talk with [Boris Mann](http://twitter.com/bmann). A few months later, I realized my site was severely lacking a blog. Sure, I built it on Jekyll[^Jekyll], but I found that the site I built sucked for blogging. I moved everything over to Medium, but my site was built on Jekyll. That makes no sense. After speaking with some more smart people, they told me to blog a lot. Medium wasn't quite working for me. So now I am back with a much simpler Jekyll blog!

I'm going to start blogging for real. I have had a bunch of experience[^Test] this summer doing a lot of weird and cool things, like squatting 1.6x my bodyweight after a knee injury, or bench pressing 1.1x my bodyweight after a shoulder injury. I also spent some time pursuing venture capital jobs with zero luck. Spoke with some more VCs after that and they told me being a low level numbers guy at a VC firm is not a great path. I really like product anyway!

Also I'm learning Ruby on Rails which is something I should write about (since you learn a lot by teaching others). Have some ideas in my head that I would like to share and I think there is a lot to gain/explore by posting them publically.

This was the first post, it's time to make a super simple theme and throw my existing portfolio onto an "about" page.

[^Jekyll]: Jekyll is a blogging platform based on a flatfile architecture. Basically I generate the blog on my computer and upload the static HTML files instead of a server fetching dynamic content for each viewer!
