I rebuilt my personal website in May after a talk with [Boris Mann](http://twitter.com/bmann). I asked him how to become a good product person. He told me that the holy trinity of marketing, product, and development is very closely tied together. Each vertex has it's own set of problems, solutions, and best practices, but nothing is truly isolated. In order to become great at product, I needed to learn the entire triangle. How does that conclusion tie in to blogging? And don't I already have a blog?

Yes I already have a blog, but the site I built became a portfolio first and a blog second. Furthermore, I will start blogging what I learn, which will make me learn more. That's all.

So what am I learning? What is the purpose of this blog? Two things. I'm going to show off what I create with Ruby on Rails. Second, I'm going to talk product with people. Eventually these two worlds will collide and I will have a strong comprehension of Rails development combined with a large body of knowledge with regards to product!
