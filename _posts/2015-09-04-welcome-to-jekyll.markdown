I played World of Warcraft (WoW) when I was a teenager. While most of it was a complete waste of time, there have been a few positives that came out of playing Blizzard Entertainment's multiplayer behemoth. Before the game finally fades away[^wow-dying], I wanted to take a look at how Blizzard used color in a very simple way to produce one of the best interfaces in gaming. This post is a key design lesson from World of Warcraft.

##Color Coded Quality
 In WoW and other online role playing games, finding or buying rare items is a core part of the game. Each item has a certain quality. It might be a high amount of armor that an item provides, or maybe it just looks really cool. That's where Color Coded Quality comes in. Also known as [item rarity](http://www.giantbomb.com/color-coded-loot/3015-4702/), Color Coded Quality is a quick way for players to check how good their items are. It's not a very complicated design element, but it's one rarely seen in interfaces.

 Look at this example:

 While this particular user's inventory seems like a mess, it's pretty easy to identify which items are higher value than the others just by referring to the very intuitive color key:
<htmL>
<div style="width: 100%; background-color: #292b2f; text-align: center; padding: 1em; font-family: Noto Sans">
    <span style="color:#9d9d9d; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Poor </span>
    <span style="color:#ffffff; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Common </span>
    <span style="color:#1eff00; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Uncommon </span>
    <span style="color:#0070dd; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Rare </span>
    <span style="color:#a335ee; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Epic </span>
    <span style="color:#ff8000; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Legendary </span>
    <span style="color:#e6cc80; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Artifact </span>
    <br><br>
    <span style="color: white; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">&#8594; Item Value &#8594;</span>
</div>
<br>
</html>

This Color Coded Quality feature actually came from an earlier Blizzard title: Diablo II, but World of Warcraft popularized it. In every single Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) there is some element of color quality and all of them follow the same color key that Blizzard invented. It comes as a huge surprise to me that very few consumer products actually use a full color key to display some information quickly.

##Non-Game Color Coded Quality

Of the few companies that do use this approach, only a small number use it in the same way as World of Warcraft. One of my favorite uses of color comes from Genius.com's "IQ" user ranking system. IQ is the amount of contribution users put towards analyzing, posting, and editing song lyrics. Without looking at the actual IQ number, it's easy to tell which users have contributed a high amount to the website versus completely new accounts.

There is room for improvement with Genius, but in general the site does a very good job at highlighting valued contributors. One thing that bothers me is how weak Eminem's color is. Maybe I'm just used to WoW's color key, but green seems a bit too light to give one of the best rappers alive.

![Google's newest email service](/assets/img/wow/inbox.png)

Google's newest email interface, [Inbox](www.inbox.google.com/), introduced smart filtering for emails. Promotions get tucked away and conversations between coworkers or friends are prominent. The use of color here is only within category icons. A few icons does not effectively display information about the content behind the subject lines.

Considering the technology behind Inbox, I am disappointed that Google hasn't done more to include some form of Color Coded Quality. There is a huge amount of potential here and I hope Google takes a long look at their interface.

##The Future of Color
Products today rarely use color effectively. It's very easy to launch a product with one color and call it "flat". I personally will be paying a lot more attention to the use of color in future products, and will probably shamelessly steal the famous color key from World of Warcraft.

Disregarding the color spectrum is a mistake. Use it well and use it wisely.

[^wow-dying]: Due to gamers falling in love with the MOBA genre, subscriptions to World of Warcraft are down [over 44%](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/08/05/world-of-warcraft-has-lost-44-of-its-subscribers-in-six-months-but-thats-okay/) in the past 6 months.
