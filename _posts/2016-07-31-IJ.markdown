![Infinite Jest](/assets/img/ij/ij.png)

I started reading Infinite Jest after I read Gravity's Rainbow. It took me about 6 months to read all 1,100 dense pages. IJ is at the top of my list of favourite books, but it's not without it's flaws and shortcomings.

Author David Foster Wallace crushes you with his encyclopedia knowledge of basically everything – and then exposes the human condition by projecting an intricate image of tennis, addiction, and relationships (and film, and physics, and politics, and...) onto a dense canvas that goes far deeper than most prose ever can.

I felt myself becoming more and more familiar with characters that reflected despicable attitudes and pathetic addictions. I think that's the point of Infinite Jest. DFW didn't write 1,100 pages to tell a story, he did it to expose just what makes a human human. Everyone is addicted to something. Everyone is chasing his own Carrot on his own Stick. Sometimes the Stick is held by your own hand. Sometimes it's held by a tennis academny. Sometimes you run away from a destructive Carrot and go to rehab – its own kind of Carrot.

The story and timeline incomprehensible without extensive study and mapping. That doesn't matter. The book is about exposing what humans do. I think that's the best part of this book.

The one flaw I found with Infinite Jest was that Wallace tried to create a circular plot structure and then found himself in a hole which needed supernatural characters to fix.

Ultimately I just can't believe a book about tennis, addiction, and film could be so powerful.

Plot issues aside, this is a perfect book.
