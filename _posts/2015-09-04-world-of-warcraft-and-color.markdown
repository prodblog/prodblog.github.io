I played World of Warcraft (WoW) when I was a teenager. While most of it was a complete waste of time, there have been a few positives that came out of playing Blizzard Entertainment's multiplayer behemoth. Before the game finally fades away[^wow-dying], I wanted to take a look at how Blizzard used color in a very simple way to popularize a significant feature in interface design. This post is a lesson in interface color usage from World of Warcraft.

##Color Coded Quality
 In WoW and other online role playing games, finding or buying rare items is a core part of the experience. Each item has a certain quality, rarity, and thus value. An item might provide a high amount of armor or maybe it just looks really cool. That's where Color Coded Quality comes in. Also known as [item rarity](http://www.giantbomb.com/color-coded-loot/3015-4702/), Color Coded Quality is a quick way for players to check how valuable their items are. It's not a very complicated design element, but it's one not used enough in interfaces.

 Look at this example:

 While this particular user's inventory is very cluttered, it's pretty easy to identify which items are higher value than the others just by referring to the very intuitive color key:
<htmL>
<div style="width: 100%; background-color: #292b2f; text-align: center; padding: 1em; font-family: Noto Sans">
    <span style="color:#9d9d9d; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Poor </span>
    <span style="color:#ffffff; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Common </span>
    <span style="color:#1eff00; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Uncommon </span>
    <span style="color:#0070dd; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Rare </span>
    <span style="color:#a335ee; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Epic </span>
    <span style="color:#ff8000; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Legendary </span>
    <span style="color:#e6cc80; margin-right: 6px; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">Artifact </span>
    <br><br>
    <span style="color: white; text-shadow: 1px 1px black">&#8594; Item Value &#8594;</span>
</div>
<br>
</html>

This Color Coded Quality feature actually came from an earlier Blizzard title: Diablo II, but World of Warcraft popularized it. In every single Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) there is some element of color quality and all of them follow the same color key that Blizzard invented. It comes as a huge surprise to me that very few consumer products actually use a full color key to display some information quickly.

##Non-Game Color Coded Quality

Of the few companies that do use this approach, only a small number use it in the same way as World of Warcraft. One of my favorite uses of color comes from Genius.com's "IQ" user ranking system. IQ is the amount of contribution users put towards analyzing, posting, and editing song lyrics. Without looking at the actual IQ number, it's easy to tell which users have contributed a high amount to the website versus completely new accounts.

Within a glance you can tell which users have more IQ points without actually reading the number. Even Eminem contributes to the website and has a decent (green) color for his profile.

![Google's newest email service](/assets/img/wow/inbox.png)

Google's newest email interface, [Inbox](www.inbox.google.com/), introduced smart filtering for emails. Promotions get tucked away and conversations between coworkers or friends are prominent. The use of color here is only within category icons. A few icons does not effectively display information about the content behind the subject lines.

Considering the technology behind Inbox, I am disappointed that Google hasn't done more to include some form of Color Coded Quality. There is a huge amount of potential here and I hope Google takes a long look at their interface. Think about how easy email would be if you just had color levels for email importance!

##The Future of Color
Products today rarely use color effectively. It's very easy to launch a product with one color and call it "flat". I personally will be paying a lot more attention to the use of color in future products, and will probably shamelessly steal the famous color key from World of Warcraft when I design something in the future.

Disregarding the color spectrum is a mistake. Use it well and use it wisely.

[^wow-dying]: Due to gamers falling in love with the MOBA genre, subscriptions to World of Warcraft are down [over 44%](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/08/05/world-of-warcraft-has-lost-44-of-its-subscribers-in-six-months-but-thats-okay/) in the past 6 months.
