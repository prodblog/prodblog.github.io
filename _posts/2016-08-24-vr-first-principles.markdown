Virtual reality requires first principles thinking. Recreating existing experiences with new control schemes is not virtual reality.

The new Oculus Rift Minecraft experience is extremely polished. It runs wonderfully and the game looks very crisp.

It's a bad VR experience though.

Minecraft took over the world because it gave gamers a digital lego game. Build anything you want, with your friends.

Lego is popular because it lets your imagination go crazy, not because you feel like you're actually inside of what you create. That's what this flavour of Minecraft tried to do. The basic principles behind Minecraft's popularity were ignored. You character is about as tall as 1.5 blocks. It's a terrible first person experience. It only works because the player is sitting a few feet away from a screen with a massive FOV slider turned up.

Minecraft hit mainstream when it launched onto consoles and mobile phones. None of these experiences places the user right in front of blocks. It places the first person character, which a player controls, in front of blocks. There's a disconnect here that Oculus Rift Minecraft fails to overcome.

Other issues related to this conversion include terrible locomotion and poor menu interaction. Pointing your head is not a good way to select menu options.

All of these issues stem from trying to place a non-VR experience into a headset. Both the Rift and Minecraft are independently excellent, but to create good VR you must start from basic first principles thinking, and create content from there.
