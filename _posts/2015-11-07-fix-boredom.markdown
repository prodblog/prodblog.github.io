My last post was about not making stupid social apps. I talked about how companies are great at optimizing their products in order to make users mindlessly use them very frequently. The past decade or so has consisted of companies popping up, capturing the attention of millions of users, and throwing ads at them. It's been very lucrative to the tiny minority that succeed, and it's a great way to become a billionaire if you're one of the lucky few founders who built one. "Not-boredom" is the feeling when you're mindlessly browsing one of these apps. Think about the numb feeling you get when you're sucked into your Instagram or Twitter feed. Very rarely do you experience a profound or extremely interesting piece of information. The more I think about it, the more I am wrong about disliking this so vehemently. Kind-of.

A lot of apps are actually great. Reddit allows me to read the opinions and thoughts of thousands of other people on any given piece of news or science. Facebook lets me talk to my friends and see what they're up to at any given moment. Snapchat gives me a window in the lives (stories) of many more people than I could possibly speak to in a single day. That's a lot better than what I might be doing otherwise (sitting on the bus and mindlessly looking out the window). It's still not perfect, but my boredom is now replaced with something at least somewhat interesting, even if the goal of the app is to make me see ads.

Part of my point still stands from my last post. I think the way we use social media (stupid apps!) needs more discipline and a better end goal. There is very little difference in effort between clicking on Instagram and clicking on the Kindle app, but the impact is large over time. One of them opens up a feed of corporate sponsored photos ([native advertising](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-products-or-brands-to-sponsor-me-on-Instagram)) and the other lets you read a book. Instagram is a great app, but it's easy to get lost in the endless scrolling habit that many people get into. It takes the tiniest amount of effort to open that Kindle app and read a book. The same goes for habits once you're inside of an app. If you're on Reddit, think about how much effort it takes it takes you to read about a new scientific discovery rather than just mindlessly browsing funny cat pictures or videos. Not a huge amount of effort, but it's detectable.

I have a feeling that the Next Big Thing in apps will have elements of inherent discipline or conscious learning within their interface. [ProductHunt](www.producthunt.com) is getting it somewhat right as the site is makes it fun to discover the best in new tech, books, games, and podcasts. With ProductHunt, I feel like I learn something every time, even if it is minuscule or ultimately not important.

I think optimizing "not-boredom" is actually a fantastic opportunity to uplift the entire world very easily. Go look at any person who is currently waiting for something (on the bus, in line at the grocery store, etc) or not doing work. They are usually on their smartphone. That's an opportunity for people to learn and grow.

The tech sector has done a great job at building products that somewhat accomplish the task of making people better, but they're mostly advertising platforms for now. Advertising is a great way to provide a free service, but ultimately the mission of a company should be to make the world a better place rather than make people see ads. I hope the next great social app helps people get better and makes it as effortless as opening up an Instagram feed and scrolling for your entire bus ride. That would be world changing, and it's why it's so hard to do.
