![Gravity's Rainbow](/assets/img/gr/gr.jpg)

Gravity's Rainbow is probably the worst piece of entertainment I have ever attempted to enjoy in my life. It is more dense than a black hole and is entirely a mockery of literature. If you end up deciphering the vast complexity of the plot you'll find Thomas Pynchon calling you a cuckold for going through all of that effort. None of the characters are realistic. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities. None of the maximalist story arcs are very interesting or compelling. The book is not satisfying to read.

Thomas Pynchon has created the least enjoyable piece of literature outside of Finnegans Wake. This book took me 6 months to finally finish and I can't say that I enjoyed very much of it. The conclusion left me feeling empty inside and I feel sorry for anyone who has attempted to give this book a thorough academic analysis.

I truly wish [GoodReads](www.goodreads.com) had a score of zero, but would be giving too much credit to Mr. Pynchon. Gravity's Rainbow has drained my energy, torn up my soul, and left me feeling like some pathetic invalid at the mercy of some overbearing patriarch.

Gravity's Rainbow was a one-way communication link from Thomas Pynchon psychotic universe directly to my brain and I regret forcing myself through this painful journey. This book left me screaming for an ending, but what I received was far beyond a zero. That's why I'm giving it a **5/5**.
