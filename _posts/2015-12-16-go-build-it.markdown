![Just build your own damn MVP!!](/assets/img/buildmvp/paper.jpg)

Would you hire an author to write a book idea you had? Would you hire a musician to sing a song you thought of? Probably not. Why would you hire a developer to build your life's work?

I once did a web design project for a "startup” that consisted of six "ideas" people and exactly zero programmers. These six people decided the best path to success was to throw thousands of dollars at an outsourced “coder” in another continent to build their "billion dollar app". Then, to “make it look good”, they hired me to do all of the front-end web design work. I ended up charging way less than I should have, but I was new at freelancing and didn't know better. I many spent hours refactoring the garbage PHP their “coder” threw together. As you can guess, the “startup” didn’t go anywhere.

Of these six “co-founders”, nobody thought about doing any of the work themselves. Have an app idea? Have a great social network you want to build? Great. Go and build it yourself.

I used to be that guy who had a million ideas and “just needed a technical co-founder”. In university, I was very fortunate to work on a project with one of my best friends who was also a great engineer. That project ultimately didn’t pan out but it was fun. I also didn’t realize at the time how lucky I was to simply be an ideas and design guy at a college startup.

The reality is that everyone has ideas. People with technical skills aren’t stupid. They have ideas too. If you show up with a cold LinkedIn message asking for free programming work in return for equity in “your” company, you're going to be laughed at. Imagine of a smart programmer came up to you and said:

>"hey I have this great idea for a shipping company called Fedex, all I need is for you to business the hell out of it. I'll even give you a generous 15%!"

Sounds silly, doesn't it?

 You know what is worth money? Execution. If your idea is so brilliant, then it means the long term value of you building the minimum viable product is very high. Go build it yourself and see if people like it. By the time you need a real engineer, you’ll have enough traction to raise money or find an interested co-founder. It’s not hard. You can build a working Twitter clone in 12 hours following a [simple tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org).

An engineering friend of mine told me that business was easy to learn and that engineering was this secret genius club that only brilliant minds were a part of. I disagree with this too. Engineering is not much more difficult than any other trade or profession. Sure, it takes a certain type of personality to design and build build a complex database architecture, but you don't need that level of complexity to just test out your idea. Furthermore, it’s entirely possible to learn the fundamentals of computer science on the weekends by reading a few books. Engineers don’t fall from the sky. Everyone started somewhere. Turn off Netflix and open up any of the hundreds of free tutorials available on the internet.

It’s not easy and it takes a lot of effort to learn, but building your own apps is very doable. Engineers aren’t magic. Just like introverts can learn to be great sales people, “brilliant” apps can be created by non-technical people. Programming was made for humans to be able to understand. Most people could learn to code if they just set their mind to it.
