![Just build your own damn MVP!!](/assets/img/buildmvp/paper.jpg)

Would you hire an author to write that book idea you had? Would you hire a musician to release an album under your name? Probably not. Why would you hire a developer to build your life's work?

I once did a web design project for a "startup” that consisted of six "ideas" people and exactly zero programmers. These six people decided the best path to success was to throw thousands of dollars at an outsourced “coder” in another continent to build their "billion dollar app". Then, to “make it look good”, they hired me to do all of the front-end web design work. I ended up charging way less than I should have, but I was new at freelancing and didn't know better. I many spent hours refactoring the garbage PHP their “coder” threw together. As you can guess, the “startup” didn’t go anywhere.

Of these six “co-founders”, nobody thought about doing any of the work themselves. Have an app idea? Have a social network you want to build? Great. Go and build it yourself.

I used to be that guy who had a million ideas and “just needed a technical co-founder”. In university, I was very fortunate to work on a project with one of my best friends who *was* a brilliant technical co-founder. That project ultimately didn’t pan out but it was fun. I also didn’t realize at the time how lucky I was to simply be an ideas and design guy at a college startup.

The reality is that everyone has ideas. People with technical skills aren’t stupid. They have ideas too. If you show up with a cold LinkedIn message asking for free programming work in return for equity in “your” company, you're going to be laughed at. Imagine if a smart programmer came up to you and said this:

>"Hey I have this great idea for a shipping startup called FedEx. All I need is for you to business the hell out of it. Just figure out the revenue model, have low costs, find me some customers, figure out basically all of the shipping logistics, and make sure every package arrives on time. In exchange, I'll generously give you 15% equity of the company (that vests in 4 years)! Don't worry: I'll build the website that tracks the packages. Plus it's my idea, so please sign this non-disclosure agreement."

Sounds silly, doesn't it? Ideas are worth nothing.

 You know what is worth money? Execution. If your idea is so brilliant, then it means the long term value of you personally building the minimum viable product is very high. Go build it yourself and see if people like it. By the time you need a real engineer, you’ll have enough traction to raise money or find an interested co-founder. It’s not hard. You can build a working Twitter clone in 12 hours following a [simple Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org).[^ph]

An engineer friend of mine once told me that business was easy to learn and that engineering was this secret genius club that only brilliant minds were a part of. I disagree with this too. Engineering and computer science are not more difficult than any other trade or profession. Sure, it takes a certain type of personality to design and build a complex database architecture, but you don't need that level of complexity to de-risk an idea. Furthermore, it’s entirely possible to learn the fundamentals of computer science on the weekends by reading a few books. Engineers don’t fall from the sky. Everyone started somewhere. Go turn off Netflix and open up any of the hundreds of free tutorials available on the internet.

It’s not exactly simple, and it takes discipline to learn, but building your own apps is very doable. Engineers aren’t magic. Just like introverts can learn to be great sales people, non-technical people can create great apps. Programming was made for humans to be able to understand, and most people could learn to code if they just set their mind to it.

[^ph]: You can even do what Ryan Hoover did with Product Hunt. He built an email list about products he liked and sent it to his friends. His traction was so high that he found a technical co-founder in a few weeks. [Read more here.](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3023152/open-company/the-wisdom-of-the-20-minute-startup)
