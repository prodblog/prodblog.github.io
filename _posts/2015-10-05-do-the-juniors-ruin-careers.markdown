I often wonder how many wonderful careers never existed because of a bad habit from the juniors.

On October 4th, Zack Kassian of the Montreal Canadiens got into a car accident at 6am. This was the eve of a brand new season with a brand new team. Everyone in his car was wasted. Apparently he wasn't driving, but it doesn't matter. He still got into a vehicle with someone who had no business behind the wheel. Kassian broke his foot and his nose. Fortunately that was the worst of the injuries.

Zack Kassian's time with his previous team, the Vancouver Canucks, was filled with tales of late parties at the local bars and clubs. Even if you ignore the rumours, there was always something off about how his playing time was distributed game to game.

Zack was touted as the next big power forward in the NHL and that never came true. Three coaches later, he was traded to Montreal for Brandon Prust (someone far older and less skilled, albeit just as likeable). Canucks general manager Jim Benning even had to throw in a draft pick to bring the deal to fruition.

Zack Kassian's time in the juniors is anything but unique. You're an all-star in a small Canadian town playing in front of the entire population every night. You're a local hero. You're at every party. You're a king. It's easy to acquire bad party habit.

I think we've all seen the type of people. Absolute king of the party. Surrounded by their "crew". For some reason humans love to arrange these social hierarchies where the successful athlete who makes bad decisions is at the top.

I distinctly remember the buzz around Vancouver when Zack Kassian was acquired from the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Cody Hodgson. Yeah we lost a promising young sniper but we gained what we thought was the next big power forward in the NHL. I remember jumping up and down every time Kass would get it together for a few games and start hitting, shooting, and scoring. The entire city exploded when he had a good game. Unfortunately he suffered from wild swings of inconsistency.

As it turns out, Kassian was in Stage 1 of the NHL's Substance Abuse and Behavioural Health Program[^stage1] for over a year before the accident. The treatment wasn't very successful and Canucks management decided everyone needed a change. After floundering under three different coaches, the Canucks traded him for peanuts. Not even one day into the new season, the Montreal Canadiens placed him into Stage 2, which means he can't even play until he gets a doctor to say he's better.

If you're good enough to make the NHL you're thrust into the limelight of the big leagues with annual salary somewhere between $525,000 and $925,000[^contract]. You're young, rich, fit, and you still feel like you're the king of the world.

Sometimes young, great players make it far enough to reach great success while still maintaining whatever bad habits they found in the juniors. Sometimes those bad habits are a play style that gets coached out of them in a few months. Sometimes those are drug habits. Only 5 years ago Mike Richards was considered one of the best forwards in the league. His bad habit caught up to him. The Los Angeles Kings just terminated his contract. He's only 30 years old.[^lakings]

I wonder how many Steve Jobs, Elizabeth Holmes, or Elon Musks we lost in the whatever their version of the juniors is. Many of these people had tough upbringings, and surely none of them had access to >$500,000/year at the age of 18. Still, it makes you wonder how many Einsteins went down the wrong path or got into some cocaine.

There's probably a reason why 25% of new companies are started by immigrants.[^immigrants] I think that has to do with a tougher upbringing and access to less leisure. I grew up with immigrant parents as well and was always pushed to do a bit more and work a little harder. Many immigrant families don't have cultural desire or economic ability to have as much leisure. I think the "juniors" of immigrant children is full of hard work and the constant drive for socioeconomic improvement.

That constant struggle to build a better life breeds more success than leisurely privilege does. It's not unlikely that we've lost a few unicorns[^unicorn] because of a youth that was just a bit too wild, a bit too close to drugs, or full of a bit too much early stardom.

The juniors matter. Imagine if we had a strong program that put Zack Kassian on the right track back when he was a 17 years old. Imagine if Mike Richards never got into drugs and was fully in his prime as one of the best forwards in game of hockey. We'd have two more amazing players in the NHL and one less car accident.

I sincerely hope both Zack Kassian and Mike Richards get better. They're supremely talented and unstoppable when they're on their game. It's too bad they got on a bad trajectory so early in life.

[^unicorn]: A "unicorn" is a startup worth at least $1,000,000,000.
[^stage1]: The Substance Abuse and Behavioural Health Program is run by the NHL to help players with their substance issues. Stage 1 is very private and allows players to continue playing. Stage 2 is more public and suspends the player without pay until a doctor signs off on them.
[^lakings]: Mike Richards has a not-so-secret drug habit that effectively destroyed his career. He once led the Philadelphia Flyers to the Stanley Cup finals and was considered one of the best two-way forwards in the league. This summer he got caught trying to smuggle oxycontin across the U.S./Canada border and now his career is probably done. The Los Angeles Kings are now paying him until 2031 NOT to play.

[^immigrants]: "From 1996 to 2011, the business startup rate of immigrants increased by more than 50 percent, while the native-born startup rate declined by 10 percent, to a 30-year low. Immigrants today are more than twice as likely to start a business as native-born citizens."

[^contract]: That's the range of entry level contracts in the NHL.
