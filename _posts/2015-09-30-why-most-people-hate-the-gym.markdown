People who have gym memberships fall into two categories.

1. They go often.
2. They go rarely.

The truth is that most people who buy gym memberships don't go regularly.[^gym-percent] Why are people spending upwards of $30/month on a membership they don't use?

Could you imagine paying for Amazon Prime but never actually ordering anything? Why do people buy gym memberships and never use them? Let's not kid ourselves, we all know the real reason. Fitness takes discipline, and discipline is fundamentally difficult to market.

The problem is actually quite simple and it lies within the decision making process of the average human:

> I want to improve my body therefore I want to buy a gym membership.

Can you see where the problem is yet? There is a fundamental disconnect between what the customer wants to pay for and what they actually get in return.

A prospective gym goer is paying money to improve their body, but what they're getting for their money is simply access to a place where they have to work hard.

The body of the ripped guy in any Men's Health Magazine is what the customer wants, but what they get is fundamentally different. Logically they know that actually going to the gym is necessary to get to their destination, but their internal desire is simply to physically look and feel better.

The entire fitness industry is extremely shallow as a result. Nobody wants to admit that the results they want take years of discipline to attain. Instead, the industry veers their marketing campaigns way below our sense of intelligence. Why do gyms, magazines, and supplements have such dumb advertising?

They do it because they have to. Nobody is going to buy something that promises results only after 416 workout sessions[^workout-calc]. People want results right away.

Sales is hard enough when you have a direct solution to a real problem. Now try selling something that is only access to a solution, rather than exactly what the customer wants. That answers why the fitness industry has such substandard advertising practices.

As a result, people end up buying something they don't actually want to participate in. They still want to feel good about having the membership, but the discipline part of the equation ends up being too much.

Humans want results, not access to a venue where you have to work hard.

[^workout-calc]: Going from average to ripped takes a good two years. You'll see results in 6 months, but it will take two years to really get there. That assumes you eat properly, have a decent routine, rarely skip workouts, and push yourself hard at the gym. Getting to the gym 4 times/week for two years results in 416 different gym sessions. Yep, it takes a lot of work.
