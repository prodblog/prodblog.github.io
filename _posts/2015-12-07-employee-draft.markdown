Why isn’t there a draft for new employees of companies? Just like in the NHL. The companies that are going through tough times get to pick first. They get to choose from the top students from the local universities.

There is a draft combine where companies can go and test out the newest stock of fresh graduates before compiling their preferred picks. Prospective employees are given spreadsheets to build, marketing documents to compile, projects to code. Each company has a core philosophy and type of employee they’re looking to draft.

IBM looks for their employees to believe in a strict hierarchy while maintaining an air of professionalism. Apple prefers programmers that can draw beautiful mockups of their database queries. Deloitte looks to young upcoming business grads who will devote late nights to increasingly larger spreadsheets.

The night of the Draft, certain companies have favourites. Some trade existing employees for other firms’ picks, in order to move up in the draft order.

“Yes Blackberry, you can have Jony as long as you give us first overall.”

The next day, Apple picks first. Alexander, a bright programmer that has already built two startups in college. Alexander is highly touted.

When the names are called on Draft Day, students stand up and hug their families. The cameras follow each young draftee as they walk up to the stage. Apple hands Alexander a jet black turtleneck before that famous draft picture. Tim Cook shakes Alexander’s hand.

*“Welcome to Apple!”*

Yahoo gives their pick a bright purple blazer. IBM gives theirs a dark blue polo shirt. Blackberry gives their pick, Arnold, a faded black t-shirt with “TEAM BLACKBERRY” sewn across the back.

Before long, each company has had their turn to pick in the first round. Then the second. Finally, when the media long since left for some other news story, the remaining five rounds of the 2016 Employment Selection Draft conclude without much drama. Pfizer sends Coke their remaining 4th and 5th draft picks in exchange for Coke’s 3rd round pick. They have an eye on a marketing graduate from Ontario with a knack for selling pharmaceuticals.

After the buzz of Draft Weekend, each company begins the process of signing their draftees to contracts. Some draftees will end up working their way up from the junior levels of marketing, engineering, or sales. Some, like Apple’s highly touted pick, will be thrust into the limelight.

Alexander has already launched two companies! Sure he has a lot to learn, but he’s mentally ready for the big leagues. Soon, Alexander will find himself in charge of spearheading the App Store redesign.

Other draftees are not so fortunate. Some end up floundering in their junior departments. Harold, Yahoo’s 3rd round pick, ends up missing three key deadlines in a row. He is sent down to Yahoo’s satellite office in Toronto to do grunt work and never recovers his confidence.

Many middle-of-the-pack draftees are thrown into lower level yet fiercely important supporting roles. Some of these picks end up doing fine work but never make any measurable impact. Some, like Melissa, end up becoming all-stars despite being ranked lower by Employment Central Scouting in their draft year. Melissa is an accounting graduate from Ohio and completes her CPA in 3 years at KPMG. She leads the firm to the 2016 Tax Provider of the Year award.

Some employees re-sign with their firms when their contracts expire. Some, like David, an expert software engineer from California, choose to explore free agency. David negotiates with other firms until finally reaching a contract that pays more and has a longer term length.

After 5 years at Apple, Arnold decides he wants a change. He notifies Tim Cook that he will not be re-signing in Cupertino. A large press conference is called and Arnold announces that he is looking for a new firm to take him in.

The media pick up on the story and it’s the talk of the summer.

“W–w–well t–this is j–just REPREHENSIBLE! HE CAN’T JUST LEAVE APPLE! THINK OF ALL THEY D–DID FOR HIM” screams Rod Sterling, analyst at CNBC during a prime time television special dubbed The Decision.

After months of speculation, Arnold holds one last press conference.

“I’m taking my talents to Microsoft.”
