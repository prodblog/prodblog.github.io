[^btc]: Remember when Bitcoin was super popular and everyone on Twitter totally believed in Bitcoin? And then everyone was really excited about Bitcoin and everyone had tons of Bitcoin and everyone *got in early* on Bitcoin, and some people even *got in early* on Litecoin! Don't forget the countless other Coins (i.e. Dogecoin). Oh and also when all the Early folks totally believed in Bitcoin but also put their entire stack of Bitcoin into cold storage because they totally believe in Bitcoin as a new currency that was going to unite the world in new economic unified unity! Oh but also we the nerds were going to show those pesky finance Villains how an economy can work when *they* don't have access to large swaths of capital. We the nerds are much more virtuous than the evil finance Villains that treat the economy like a game! Oh but have you seen the Bitcoin charts lately? It's up to nearly $1,200 USD! And I *got in* at only $300! Yeah my cold storage is super cold. It's so cold in fact that my entire stack of Bitcoin wallet papers are IN THE FREEZER! Oh and also when the Heroes (vs. Villains) owned like 90% of all Bitcoins and were sitting there waiting for their Bitcoin to go up? And when the Nerds on stage who owned like maybe 90% of all Bitcoins were smugly telling everyone how amazing Bitcoin was and how everyone should start mining and how exciting it was that China got all in to Bitcoin and how great Bitcoin was going to be for the world? And how at the end of the day every single one of our Nerd Heroes who *got in early* was in fact the same very Villain that they were so smugly against. They same Nerds who sit there waiting for their Bitcoins that were permanently deleted from their Macbook Airs and printed out on to paper and then locked away literally in a safe somewhere to appreciate – but totally not the same way that Villains use markets to try and get returns. Oh and also don't forget the entire libraries of Medium posts telling us all why we were *so fucking lucky* to be getting in to Bitcoin at this very early hour and that we should most definitely go and get some more Bitcoin and pour money into it. Did you know that *they* got 1,000x returns just by getting in early? Don't worry! You – a fellow Nerd – could also get these gigantic returns just by getting in now! I mean look at all these places that are accepting Bitcoins and allowing you to literally spend money! Those nerds that quickly became the very Villains they were trying to avoid becoming, but in the end realized they were made up of the same greedy building blocks their rivals were made of: human nature.
